## RESEARCH PROJECTS:
### Some Problems in Number Fields
Studied Kummer Theory and worked on the refinement of Gauss‚Äô Theorem on Primitive Roots. Also, solved
the problem of balancing the centrifuge by drawing references from research papers on the vanishing sums of
distinct roots of unity.

### Topological Insulators
Studied Berry Phase and Berry Connection for discrete as well as continuum cases and solved some interesting unsolved problems on the same topic.

- **Beal‚Äôs Conjecture and Fermat‚Äôs Theorem**
- Studied a constructive proof of Beal‚Äôs conjecture by Nicholas J. Daras, ‚ÄòPrimitive integral solutions to ùë•^2 + ùë¶^3 = ùëß^10 by David Brown‚Äô and the ‚Äòspecial case of the generalized Fermat equation ùë•^2 + ùë¶^3 = ùëß^15 by Samir Siksek and Michael Stoll‚Äô.

**Research Intern @ Bhaskaracharya Pratishthana, Pune (_June 2018 - July 2018_)**
- **Algebraic Number Theory**
- Studied parts of books like The TIFR Pamphlet on Algebraic Number Theory, Stewart and Tall‚Äôs Algebraic Number Theory, and notes.
- Discussed general themes and problems in Algebraic Number Theory.
