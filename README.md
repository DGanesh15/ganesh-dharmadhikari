## RESEARCH PROJECTS:
### Some Problems in Number Fields
Studied Kummer Theory and worked on the refinement of Gauss‚Äô Theorem on Primitive Roots. Also, solved
the problem of balancing the centrifuge by drawing references from research papers on the vanishing sums of
distinct roots of unity.

### Topological Insulators
Studied Berry Phase and Berry Connection for discrete as well as continuum cases and solved some interesting unsolved problems on the same topic.
