- Demonstrated the comparison between MS Excel and TK-solver in the workshop.
- Worked on the project ‘Computing Farey Codes and Invariants of Finite Index Subgroups of Modular Group’.
- Served as a technical committee member of ‘A Trimester Program on Triangle Groups, Belyi Uniformization, and Modularity’ to handle invitations, website, maintaining schedule, talks, and meetings.

## Projects
### Some Problems in Number Fields

Studied Kummer Theory and also worked on the refinement of Gauss’ Theorem on Primitive Roots. Also, solved
the problem of balancing the centrifuge by drawing references from research papers on the vanishing sums of
distinct roots of unity.


### Topological Insulators
Studied Berry Phase and Berry Connection for discrete as well as continuum cases and solved some interesting unsolved problems on the same topic.

## PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE IN RESEARCH CENTERS:
**Research Intern @ IISER, Thiruvananthapuram (_June 2019 - July 2019_)**
- **Beal’s Conjecture and Fermat’s Theorem**
- Studied a constructive proof of Beal’s conjecture by Nicholas J. Daras, ‘Primitive integral solutions to 𝑥2 + 𝑦3 = 𝑧10 by David Brown’ and the ‘special case of the generalized Fermat equation 𝑥2 + 𝑦3 = 𝑧15 by Samir Siksek and Michael Stoll’.

**Research Intern @ Bhaskaracharya Pratishthana, Pune (_June 2018 - July 2018_)**
- **Algebraic Number Theory**
- Studied parts of books like The TIFR Pamphlet on Algebraic Number Theory, Stewart and Tall’s Algebraic Number Theory, and notes.
- Discussed general themes and problems in Algebraic Number Theory.
